Develop a simple image encryption tool using pixel manipulation. support operations like swapping pixel values or applying a basic mathematical operation to each pixel.
This program hides your image using a random key and shows it back using the same key.

It uses a method called XOR, which mixes the image pixels with the key.

The same key is used again to get the original image back.

It creates two new images:

encrypted_image.png – scrambled and unreadable

decrypted_image.png – looks like your original image
